# NOTES
#
# 1) You need to set DOCBOOK to point to the root of your docbook
#    files either by editing this Makefile or setting DOCBOOK
#    appropriately in your environment and using 'make -e'. The DocBook
#    XSL files are available on the web from:
#      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935#files
#    The Makefile looks for the stylesheets in $DOCBOOK/XSL subdirectory.
#
# 2) You need xsltproc and xmllint in your path. If you are using the
#    Solaris distribution you should already have these tools installed
#    in /usr/bin.
#
# 3) The default target generates one big flat HTML file. Use the
#    'make index.html' target to generate chunked HTML (which will
#    produce one HTML file per section, plus an index as index.html).
#
# 4) A 'make check' target is provided to check the xml source for
#    compliance with the docbook 4.4 DTD (provided as docbookx.dtd).
#    Since the xml provided here was generated from POD source there
#    are a few existing DTD errors.
#
# 5) The provided CSS file should be made available with the resulting
#    HTML. Feel free to edit it as you like, the default one provided
#    here gives the document an opensolaris.org look-and-feel.
