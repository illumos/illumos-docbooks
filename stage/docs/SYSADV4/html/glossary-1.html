             <a name="glossary-1"></a><h3>Glossary</h3><a name="glossary-16"></a><b><tt>asppp</tt></b><p>A version of PPP that was included with the Solaris Operating System from
the Solaris 2.4 to the Solaris 8 releases. <tt>asppp</tt> supported asynchronous PPP communications
only.</p><a name="glossary-15"></a><b>asynchronous PPP</b><p>A form of PPP that runs over asynchronous serial lines, which transfer data
one character at a time. The most common form of PPP configuration, the
dial-up link, uses asynchronous PPP communications.</p><a name="glossary-24"></a><b>authentication</b><p>The act of verifying the identity that is supplied over the network by
a remote user or entity, such as a program. Some authentication protocols enable
you to build databases of authentication credentials from potential users. Other authentication protocols
use certificate chains of trust that are generated by a certificate authority for
authentication purposes. These credentials can authenticate users when they try to communicate with you
or use your site's services.</p><a name="glossary-2"></a><b>broadcast</b><p>A data-link layer procedure that is used to transmit packets to every machine
on a subnet. Broadcast packets are typically not routed beyond the subnet.</p><a name="glossary-40"></a><b>Callback Control Protocol (CBCP)</b><p>A proprietary Microsoft PPP extension that is used to negotiate a callback session.
 Solaris PPP 4.0 supports only the client (initial caller) side of this
protocol.</p><a name="glossary-33"></a><b>channel service unit (CSU)</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that provides a local interface to a leased telecommunications
line and terminates that line. In the United States, a CSU terminates a
T1 line and provides a DS1 or DSX interface. Internationally, the CSU is
typically owned by the telephone company provider.</p><p>See also <a href="#glossary-22">CSU/DSU</a> and <a href="#glossary-34">data service unit (DSU)</a>.</p><a name="glossary-250"></a><b>CHAP</b><p>The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol is an authentication protocol that can be used
to verify the identity of a caller on a PPP link. CHAP authentication
uses the notion of the <b>challenge</b> and <b>response</b>, where the machine that
receives a call challenges the caller to prove its identity. </p><p>See also <a href="#glossary-25">password authentication protocol (PAP)</a>. </p><a name="glossary-26"></a><b>CHAP secret</b><p>An ASCII or binary string  that is used for identification purposes and
is known to both peers on a PPP link. The CHAP secret
is stored in clear text in a system's <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt> file but is never sent
over the PPP link, not even in encrypted form. The CHAP protocol verifies
that a hash of the CHAP secret that is used by a
caller matches a hash of the CHAP secret entry for the caller in
the recipient's <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt> file.</p><a name="glossary-29"></a><b>chat script</b><p>Instructions that tell a modem how to establish a communications link between itself
and a remote peer. Both the PPP and UUCP protocols use chat scripts
for establishing dial-up links and dial-back calling.</p><a name="glossary-38"></a><b>Compression Control Protocol (CCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that negotiates the use of data compression on the
link.  Unlike header compression, CCP compresses all data within packets that are
sent on the link.</p><a name="glossary-22"></a><b>CSU/DSU</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that combines the CSU and DSU devices and is
used on a leased-line PPP link. The CSU/DSU translates signals from a peer
to a leased line. Most CSU/DSUs do not need a chat script to
establish the link. CSU/DSUs are often configured by the leased-line provider.</p><p>See also <a href="#glossary-33">channel service unit (CSU)</a> and <a href="#glossary-34">data service unit (DSU)</a>.</p><a name="glossary-34"></a><b>data service unit (DSU)</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that is used on a leased-line PPP link. The
DSU converts between data-framing formats that are used on telecommunications lines and provides
a standard data communications interface. </p><p>See also <a href="#glossary-33">channel service unit (CSU)</a> and <a href="#glossary-22">CSU/DSU</a>.</p><a name="glossary-19"></a><b>dial-in server</b><p>The peer that negotiates and establishes the recipient end of a dial-up PPP
link after receiving a call from a dial-out machine. Though the term &ldquo;dial-in
server&rdquo; is in common use, the dial-in server does not function in accordance
with the client-server paradigm. Rather, it is simply the peer that responds to
the request to set up a dial-up link. After it is configured, a
dial-in server can receive calls from any number of dial-out machines.</p><a name="glossary-20"></a><b>dial-out machine</b><p>The peer that initiates the call to establish a dial-up PPP link. After
it is configured, the dial-out machine can call any number of dial-in servers.
The dial-out machine typically provides authentication credentials before the dial-up link can be
established.</p><a name="glossary-18"></a><b>dial-up PPP link</b><p>A PPP connection that involves a peer and a modem at either end
of a telephone line or similar communications medium, such as a medium that
is provided by ISDN. The term &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; refers to the sequence in link
negotiation when the local modem dials up the remote peer by using the
peer's telephone number. The dial-up link is the most common and least expensive
PPP configuration.</p><a name="glossary-3"></a><b>Directory Agent (DA)</b><p>Optional SLP agent that stores and maintains a cache of service advertisements that
are sent by the service agent (SA). When deployed, the DA resolves user
agent (UA) service requests. The DA responds to active solicitations from the SA
and UA for directory advertisements. As a result, the SA and UA discover
the associated DAs and <b>scopes</b>. A DA sends periodic unsolicited advertisements through which
UAs and SAs discover the DA within shared scopes.</p><a name="glossary-32"></a><b>expect-send</b><p>A scripting format that is used in PPP and UUCP chat scripts. The
chat script begins with the text or instruction to <b>expect</b> from the remote
peer. The next line contains the response to be <b>sent</b> from the local
host after it receives the correct expect string from the peer. Subsequent lines
repeat the expect-send instructions between local host and peer until all instructions that
are required to establish communications are successfully negotiated.</p><a name="glossary-45"></a><b>extended accounting</b><p>A flexible way to record resource consumption on a task or process basis
in the Solaris Operating System.</p><a name="glossary-36"></a><b>Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that negotiates the IP addresses of the peers on
the link. IPCP also negotiates header compression for the link and enables the
use of the network layer protocols.</p><a name="glossary-37"></a><b>Internet Protocol Version 6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP)</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-36">Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)</a>.</p><a name="glossary-21"></a><b>ISDN terminal adaptor (TA)</b><p>A signal-adapting device that provides a modem-like interface for a dial-up PPP link
over an ISDN network. You use the same Solaris PPP 4.0 configuration files
to configure an ISDN TA as you use for configuring a standard modem.</p><a name="glossary-23"></a><b>leased-line PPP link</b><p>A PPP connection that involves a host and a CSU/DSU that are connected
to a synchronous network medium leased from a provider. OC3 and T1 are
common examples of leased-line media. Though easier to administer, leased-line links are more
expensive than dial-up PPP links and, therefore, are less common.</p><a name="glossary-4"></a><b>legacy services</b><p>A networked service that is not SLP-enabled. You can create a proxy registration
to register a legacy service with SLP. SLP-based clients can then discover legacy
services (see <a href="legacy-7.html">Chapter&nbsp;10, Incorporating Legacy Services</a>).</p><a name="glossary-17"></a><b>link</b><p>In PPP, the communications connection that is negotiated and established between two peers.
Solaris PPP 4.0 supports two types of links: dial up and leased line.</p><a name="glossary-35"></a><b>link control protocol (LCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that is used to negotiate the initial set of
link parameters between the peers.  Part of the function of LCP
is to test the link integrity, so many link-related problems manifest themselves as LCP
failure.</p><a name="glossary-39"></a><b>Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)</b><p>A proprietary Microsoft authentication protocol for PPP. Solaris PPP 4.0 supports versions 1
and 2 of this protocol in both client and server mode.</p><a name="glossary-5"></a><b>multicast</b><p>A network layer procedure that is used to send datagram packets to multiple
machines on an IP network. Packets are not handled by every machine as
is the situation with broadcast routing. Multicast requires that routers be configured with
special routing protocols.</p><a name="glossary-25"></a><b>password authentication protocol (PAP)</b><p>An authentication protocol that can be used to verify the identity of a
caller on a PPP link. PAP uses a cleartext password that is passed
over the link, which makes it possible to store the password on
one of the endpoint machines. For example, PAP can use the login and
password entries in the UNIX <tt>passwd</tt> database on the machine that receives a call
to verify the identity of the caller.</p><p>See also <a href="#glossary-250">CHAP</a>.</p><a name="glossary-13"></a><b>peer</b><p>In PPP, an individual computer at one end of a PPP communications link,
which consists of two peers that are connected by communications media. You can
configure many types of computing equipment as a peer, such as a
workstation, personal computer, router, or mainframe.</p><a name="glossary-14"></a><b>point-to-point protocol (PPP)</b><p>A data-link layer protocol that provides a standard method for transferring datagrams over
point-to-point media. A PPP configuration consists of two endpoint computers called <b>peers</b>, and the
telephone lines or another bidirectional link that the peers use for communication. The
hardware and software connection between the two peers is considered the <b>PPP link</b>.
</p><p>PPP is composed of a number of subprotocols, including PAP, CHAP, LCP, and
CCP. Numerous PPP implementations are available. The Solaris 9 Operating System includes Solaris
PPP 4.0. </p><a name="glossary-27"></a><b>PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)</b><p>A proprietary protocol from RedBack Networks that enables hosts to run PPP sessions
over an Ethernet link. PPPoE is commonly used with Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
services.</p><a name="glossary-6"></a><b>scope</b><p>A grouping of UAs and SAs that are arranged administratively, topologically, or in
some other manner. You can use scopes to modify how you provision access
to services across the enterprise.</p><a name="glossary-7"></a><b>service advertisements</b><p>Information that is distributed by an SA that describes a service. A service
advertisement consists of a URL and a collection of attribute/value list pairs that
describe a service. All service advertisements have a lifetime. After the lifetime expires,
a service advertisement is no longer valid unless reregistered.</p><a name="glossary-8"></a><b>Service Agent (SA)</b><p>The SLP agent that maintains service advertisements for networked services. If no DA
is available, the SA answers multicast service requests from UAs. If a DA
is available, the SA registers and, optionally, deregisters services with DAs that support
its scopes.</p><a name="glossary-9"></a><b>service URL</b><p>A URL that is used to advertise the network location of services. The
URL contains the service type, host name, or network address of the
service host. The URL might also contain a port number and other information
that is required to use the service.</p><a name="glossary-10"></a><b>SLP daemon (slpd)</b><p>The daemon process that acts as a DA or an SA server
in the Solaris implementation of SLP. Service processes on the host register service advertisements
with <tt>slpd</tt> instead of maintaining the advertisements individually. Each process contains an SA
client library that communicates with <tt>slpd</tt> when the daemon is configured as the
SA server. The SLP daemon forwards all registrations and deregistrations to DAs. The daemon
times out expired service advertisements and maintains a table of the available DAs
by performing active and passive DA discovery. Through such mechanisms, DA information is
provided to UA clients. UA clients use <tt>slpd</tt> on a host only
for DA information. You can optionally configure <tt>slpd</tt> as a DA.</p><a name="glossary-150"></a><b>synchronous PPP</b><p>A form of PPP that runs over synchronous digital lines, which transfer data
as a continuous stream of raw bits. The leased-line PPP link uses synchronous
PPP.</p><a name="glossary-31"></a><b>trusted callers</b><p>In PPP, remote peers that a dial-in server grants access to by including
the peers' security credentials in the server's PAP or CHAP secrets database.</p><a name="glossary-11"></a><b>User Agent (UA)</b><p>The SLP agent that acts on behalf of the user application. The agent
queries for the identity of corresponding scopes, directory agents, and service advertisements.</p>
