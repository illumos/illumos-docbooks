</sect1><sect1 id="legacy-16"><title>Considerations When Advertising Legacy Services</title><para>Generally, modifying the source code to add SLP is preferable to writing
a SLP-enabled service that uses the SLP API to advertise on behalf of other
services. Modifying the source code is also preferable to using proxy registration.
When you modify the source code, you can add service-specific features and
closely track service availability. If the source code is unavailable, writing
an SLP-enabled helper service that advertises on behalf of other services
is preferable to using proxy registration. Ideally, this helper service
is integrated into the service start/stop procedure that is used to control
activation and deactivation. Proxy advertising is generally the third choice,
when no source code is available and writing a standalone SA is impractical. </para><para>Proxy
advertisements are maintained only if <command>slpd</command> is running
to read the proxy registration file. No direct connection exists between
the proxy advertisement and the service. If an advertisement times out or <command>slpd</command> is halted, the proxy advertisement is no longer available.</para><para>If the service is shut down, <command>slpd</command> must be stopped.
The serialized registration file is edited to comment out or remove the
proxy advertisement, and <command>slpd</command> is restarted. You must
follow the same procedure when the service is restarted or reinstalled.
The lack of connection between the proxy advertisement and the service is
a major disadvantage of proxy advertisements.</para>
