</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-24"><glossterm>authentication</glossterm><glossdef><para>The act of verifying the identity that is supplied over the
network by a remote user or entity, such as a program. Some authentication
protocols enable you to build databases of authentication credentials from
potential users. Other authentication protocols use certificate chains of
trust that are generated by a certificate authority for authentication purposes.
These credentials can authenticate users when they try to communicate with
you or use your site's services.</para>

</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-250"><glossterm>CHAP</glossterm><glossdef><para>The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol is an authentication protocol that can be used to verify the identity of
a caller on a PPP link. CHAP authentication uses the notion of the <emphasis>challenge</emphasis> and <emphasis>response</emphasis>, where the machine that receives

purposes and is known to both peers on a PPP link. The CHAP secret is stored
in clear text in a system's <filename>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</filename> file

protocol verifies that a hash of the CHAP secret that is used by a caller
matches a hash of the CHAP secret entry for the caller in the recipient's <filename>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</filename> file.</para>

CSU and DSU devices and is used on a leased-line PPP link. The CSU/DSU translates
signals from a peer to a leased line. Most CSU/DSUs do not need a chat script

of a dial-up PPP link after receiving a call from a dial-out machine. Though
the term &ldquo;dial-in server&rdquo; is in common use, the dial-in server
does not function in accordance with the client-server paradigm. Rather, it
is simply the peer that responds to the request to set up a dial-up link.
After it is configured, a dial-in server can receive calls from any number
of dial-out machines.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-20"><glossterm>dial-out machine</glossterm><glossdef><para>The peer that initiates the call to establish a dial-up PPP

end of a telephone line or similar communications medium, such as a medium
that is provided by ISDN. The term &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; refers to the sequence

the peer's telephone number. The dial-up link is the most common and least
expensive PPP configuration.</para>

</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-3"><glossterm>Directory Agent (DA)</glossterm><glossdef><para>Optional SLP agent that stores and maintains a cache of service
advertisements that are sent by the service agent (SA). When deployed, the
DA resolves user agent (UA) service requests. The DA responds to active solicitations
from the SA and UA for directory advertisements. As a result, the SA and UA
discover the associated DAs and <emphasis>scopes</emphasis>. A DA sends periodic
unsolicited advertisements through which UAs and SAs discover the DA within
shared scopes.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-32"><glossterm>expect-send</glossterm><glossdef><para>A scripting format that is used in PPP and UUCP chat scripts.
The chat script begins with the text or instruction to <emphasis>expect</emphasis> from
the remote peer. The next line contains the response to be <emphasis>sent</emphasis> from
the local host after it receives the correct expect string from the peer.
Subsequent lines repeat the expect-send instructions between local host and
peer until all instructions that are required to establish communications
are successfully negotiated.</para>

</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-23"><glossterm>leased-line PPP link</glossterm><glossdef><para>A PPP connection that involves a host and a CSU/DSU that are
connected to a synchronous network medium leased from a provider. OC3 and
T1 are common examples of leased-line media. Though easier to administer,
leased-line links are more expensive than dial-up PPP links and, therefore,
are less common.</para>

be configured with special routing protocols.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-25"><glossterm>password authentication protocol (PAP)</glossterm><glossdef><para>An authentication protocol that can be used to verify the
identity of a caller on a PPP link. PAP uses a cleartext password that is
passed over the link, which makes it possible to store the password on one
of the endpoint machines. For example, PAP can use the login and password
entries in the UNIX <command>passwd</command> database on the machine that

the telephone lines or another bidirectional link that the peers use for communication.
The hardware and software connection between the two peers is considered the <emphasis>PPP link</emphasis>. </para><para>PPP is composed of a number of subprotocols,

service. A service advertisement consists of a URL and a collection of attribute/value
list pairs that describe a service. All service advertisements have a lifetime.
After the lifetime expires, a service advertisement is no longer valid unless
reregistered.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-8"><glossterm>Service Agent (SA)</glossterm><glossdef><para>The SLP agent that maintains service advertisements for networked

services with DAs that support its scopes.</para>

is required to use the service.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry><glossentry id="glossary-10"><glossterm>SLP daemon (slpd)</glossterm><glossdef><para>The daemon process that acts as a DA or an SA server in the
Solaris implementation of SLP. Service processes on the host register service
advertisements with <literal>slpd</literal> instead of maintaining the advertisements
individually. Each process contains an SA client library that communicates
with <literal>slpd</literal> when the daemon is configured as the SA server.
The SLP daemon forwards all registrations and deregistrations to DAs. The
daemon times out expired service advertisements and maintains a table of the
available DAs by performing active and passive DA discovery. Through such
mechanisms, DA information is provided to UA clients. UA clients use <literal>slpd</literal> on a host only for DA information. You can optionally configure <literal>slpd</literal> as a DA.</para>
