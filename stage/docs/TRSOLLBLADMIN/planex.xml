are modeled in this example. To protect the corporation's intellectual property,
the company's legal department mandates that employees use three labels on
all sensitive email and printed materials. The three labels, from most sensitive
to least sensitive are the following:</para><listitem><para><literal>SecCompany Confidential: Registered</literal></para>
</listitem><listitem><para><literal>SecCompany Confidential: Need To Know</literal></para>
</listitem><listitem><para><literal>SecCompany Confidential: Internal Use Only</literal></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>The legal department also approves the use of an optional fourth label, <literal>Public</literal>. The <literal>Public</literal> label is for information that
can be distributed to anyone without restrictions.</para><sect2 id="planex-11"><title>Satisfying Information Protection Goals</title><para>At SecCompany, Inc, the manager in charge of Information Protection
makes use of all possible channels to communicate labeling requirements. However,
some employees do not understand the requirements. Other employees forget
about requirements or ignore the requirements. Even when labels are properly
applied, the information is not always properly handled, stored, and distributed.
For example, reports indicate that even Registered information is sometimes
found unattended. Copies of Registered information have been left next to
copy machines and printers, in break rooms, or in lobbies.</para><itemizedlist><para>The legal department wants a better way to ensure that information is
properly labeled without relying totally on employee compliance. The system
administrators want a better way to control the following:</para><listitem><para>Who can see or modify sensitive information</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="planex-6"><title>Analyzing the Requirements for Each Label</title><para>The security administrator agrees that the set of labels that are mandated
by the legal department is a useful starting point. However, the further analysis
is needed before the labels can be encoded.</para><sect2 id="planex-8"><title>Requirements for <literal>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</literal></title><para>The <literal>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</literal> label is for
information that is proprietary to the company but which, because of its low
level of sensitivity, can be distributed to all employees. All employees have
signed nondisclosure agreements before starting employment. Information with
this label might also be distributed to others. For example, the employees
of vendors and contractors who have signed a nondisclosure agreement can receive
the information. Because the Internet can be snooped, information with this
label cannot be sent over the Internet. The information can be sent over email
within the company.</para><itemizedlist><para>Candidates for the <literal>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</literal> label

for information that is proprietary to the company, has a higher level of
sensitivity than <literal>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</literal>, and has a more limited
audience. Distribution is limited to employees who need to know the information.
Other people who need to know the information and who have signed nondisclosure
agreements might also be in the audience.</para><para>For example, if only the group of people working in a particular project

a particular group, the name of the group should be specified on the paper

information must be numbered and be tracked by the owner. Each copy must be
assigned to a specific person. The copy must be returned to the owner for
destruction after being read. Copies can be made only by the owner of the
information. Use of brownish-red paper is recommended because this color cannot
be copied.</para><para>This label is to be used when only one specific group of people should
be allowed to see the proprietary information. This information cannot be
shown to anyone who is not authorized by the owner. The information cannot
be shown to employees of other companies who have not signed a nondisclosure
agreement, even if the owner authorizes the disclosure. Information with this

Therefore, <literal>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</literal> and <literal>PUBLIC</literal> labels do not need further qualification. The <literal>NEED_TO_KNOW</literal> label does need to be associated with non-hierarchical words, such
as <literal>NEED_TO_KNOW MARKETING</literal> or <literal>NEED_TO_KNOW ENGINEERING</literal>. The words that identify the group or department can also be included
in a user's clearance, as part of establishing that user's need to know.</para>
