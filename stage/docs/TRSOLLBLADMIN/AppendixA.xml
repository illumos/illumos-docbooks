* This version of the label_encodings file encodes the Sun
* confidential labels that are required by Sun's
* legal and information protection departments. The prefix
* COMPANY is omitted from the labels for
* brevity. This encodings includes some example department
* names that can be used for controlling access to information
* across department boundaries. Commercial sites with different
* requirements can copy this file and change the definitions to suit.

* This example shows how to specify labels that meet an actual
* site's legal information  protection requirements for
* labeling email and printer output. These labels can also
* be used to enforce mandatory access control checks that are 
* based on user clearance labels, and on labels on files
* and directories.
