<a name="gbchy"></a><h3>Migrating ZFS Storage Pools</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you might need to move a storage pool between machines. To do
so, the storage devices must be disconnected from the original machine and reconnected
to the destination machine. This task can be accomplished by physically recabling the
devices, or by using multiported devices such as the devices on a SAN.
ZFS enables you to export the pool from one machine and import it
on the destination machine, even if the machines are of different endianness. For
information about replicating or migrating file systems between different storage pools, which might
reside on different machines, see <a href="gbchx.html">Saving and Restoring ZFS Data</a>.<a name="indexterm-227"></a><a name="indexterm-228"></a></p>

<li><p><a href="#gcikw">Upgrading ZFS Storage Pools</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="gazre"></a><h4>Preparing for ZFS Storage Pool Migration</h4>
<p>Storage pools should be explicitly exported to indicate that they are ready to
be migrated. This operation flushes any unwritten data to disk, writes data to
the disk indicating that the export was done, and removes all knowledge of
the pool from the system.</p><p>If you do not explicitly export the pool, but instead remove the
disks manually, you can still import the resulting pool on another system. However, you
might lose the last few seconds of data transactions, and the pool
will appear faulted on the original machine because the devices are no longer
present. By default, the destination machine refuses to import a pool that has
not been explicitly exported. This condition is necessary to prevent accidentally importing an active
pool that consists of network attached storage that is still in use on
another system.</p>

<a name="gazqr"></a><h4>Exporting a ZFS Storage Pool</h4>
<p>To export a pool, use the <tt>zpool export</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool export tank</b></tt></pre><p>Once this command is executed, the pool <tt>tank</tt> is no longer visible on
the system. The command attempts to unmount any mounted file systems within the
pool before continuing. If any of the file systems fail to unmount, you
can forcefully unmount them by using the <tt>-f</tt> option. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool export tank</b></tt>
cannot unmount '/export/home/eschrock': Device busy
# <tt><b>zpool export -f tank</b></tt></pre><p>If devices are unavailable at the time of export, the disks cannot
be specified as cleanly exported. If one of these devices is later attached
to a system without any of the working devices, it appears as &ldquo;potentially active.&rdquo;
If ZFS volumes are in use in the pool, the pool cannot
be exported, even with the <tt>-f</tt> option. To export a pool with an
ZFS volume, first make sure that all consumers of the volume are no
longer active.<a name="indexterm-229"></a><a name="indexterm-230"></a><a name="indexterm-231"></a></p><p>For more information about ZFS volumes, see <a href="gaypf.html">ZFS Volumes</a>.</p>

<a name="gazru"></a><h4>Determining Available Storage Pools to Import</h4>
<p>Once the pool has been removed from the system (either through export or
by forcefully removing the devices), attach the devices to the target system. Although
ZFS can handle some situations in which only a portion of the
devices is available, all devices within the pool must be moved between the
systems. The devices do not necessarily have to be attached under the same
device name. ZFS detects any moved or renamed devices, and adjusts the configuration
appropriately. To discover available pools, run the <tt>zpool import</tt> command with no options. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import</b></tt>
  pool: tank
    id: 3778921145927357706
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        tank        ONLINE
          mirror    ONLINE
            c1t0d0  ONLINE
            c1t1d0  ONLINE</pre><p>In this example, the pool <tt>tank</tt> is available to be imported on the
target system. Each pool is identified by a name as well as a
unique numeric identifier. If multiple pools available to import have the same name,
you can use the numeric identifier to distinguish between them.<a name="indexterm-232"></a><a name="indexterm-233"></a><a name="indexterm-234"></a></p><p>Similar to the <tt>zpool status</tt> command, the <tt>zpool import</tt> command refers to a knowledge
article available on the web with the most up-to-date information regarding repair procedures
for a problem that is preventing a pool from being imported. In this
case, the user can force the pool to be imported. However, importing a
pool that is currently in use by another system over a storage network
can result in data corruption and panics as both systems attempt to write
to the same storage. If some devices in the pool are not available
but enough redundancy is available to have a usable pool, the pool appears
in the <tt>DEGRADED</tt> state. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import</b></tt>
  pool: tank
    id: 3778921145927357706
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool can be imported despite missing or damaged devices.  The
        fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised if imported.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-2Q
config:

        tank         DEGRADED
          mirror     DEGRADED
            c1t0d0   UNAVAIL   cannot open
            c1t1d0   ONLINE</pre><p>In this example, the first disk is damaged or missing, though you
can still import the pool because the mirrored data is still accessible. If
too many faulted or missing devices are present, the pool cannot be imported. For
example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import</b></tt>
  pool: dozer
    id: 12090808386336829175
 state: FAULTED
action: The pool cannot be imported. Attach the missing
        devices and try again.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-6X
config:
        raidz               FAULTED
          c1t0d0    ONLINE
          c1t1d0    FAULTED
          c1t2d0    ONLINE
          c1t3d0    FAULTED</pre><p>In this example, two disks are missing from a RAID-Z virtual device, which
means that sufficient redundant data is not available to reconstruct the pool. In
some cases, not enough devices are present to determine the complete configuration. In
this case, ZFS doesn't know what other devices were part of the pool,
though ZFS does report as much information as possible about the situation. For
example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import</b></tt>
pool: dozer
    id: 12090808386336829175
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool cannot be imported. Attach the missing
        devices and try again.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-6X
config:
        dozer          FAULTED   missing device
          raidz       ONLINE
            c1t0d0    ONLINE
            c1t1d0    ONLINE
            c1t2d0    ONLINE
            c1t3d0    ONLINE
        Additional devices are known to be part of this pool, though their
        exact configuration cannot be determined.</pre>

<a name="gaztk"></a><h4>Finding ZFS Storage Pools From Alternate Directories</h4>
<p>By default, the <tt>zpool import</tt> command only searches devices within the <tt>/dev/dsk</tt> directory. If
devices exist in another directory, or you are using pools backed by files,
you must use the <tt>-d</tt> option to search different directories. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool create dozer mirror /file/a /file/b</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool export dozer</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool import -d /file</b></tt>
  pool: dozer
    id: 10952414725867935582
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer        ONLINE
          mirror     ONLINE
            /file/a  ONLINE
            /file/b  ONLINE
# <tt><b>zpool import -d /file dozer</b></tt></pre><p>If devices exist in multiple directories, you can specify multiple <tt>-d</tt> options.<a name="indexterm-235"></a><a name="indexterm-236"></a><a name="indexterm-237"></a></p>

<a name="gazuf"></a><h4>Importing ZFS Storage Pools</h4>
<p>Once a pool has been identified for import, you can import it
by specifying the name of the pool or its numeric identifier as an
argument to the <tt>zpool import</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import tank</b></tt></pre><p>If multiple available pools have the same name, you can specify which pool
to import using the numeric identifier. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import</b></tt>
  pool: dozer
    id: 2704475622193776801
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer       ONLINE
          c1t9d0    ONLINE

  pool: dozer
    id: 6223921996155991199
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer       ONLINE
          c1t8d0    ONLINE
# <tt><b>zpool import dozer</b></tt>
cannot import 'dozer': more than one matching pool
import by numeric ID instead
# <tt><b>zpool import 6223921996155991199</b></tt></pre><p>If the pool name conflicts with an existing pool name, you can
import the pool under a different name. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import dozer zeepool</b></tt></pre><p>This command imports the exported pool <tt>dozer</tt> using the new name <tt>zeepool</tt>. If
the pool was not cleanly exported, ZFS requires the <tt>-f</tt> flag to prevent
users from accidentally importing a pool that is still in use on another
system. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import dozer</b></tt>
cannot import 'dozer': pool may be in use on another system
use '-f' to import anyway
# <tt><b>zpool import -f dozer</b></tt></pre><p>Pools can also be imported under an alternate root by using the
<tt>-R</tt> option. For more information on alternate root pools, see <a href="gbcgl.html">Using ZFS Alternate Root Pools</a>.<a name="indexterm-238"></a><a name="indexterm-239"></a><a name="indexterm-240"></a></p>

<a name="gcfhw"></a><h4>Recovering Destroyed ZFS Storage Pools</h4>
<p>You can use the <tt>zpool import</tt> <tt>-D</tt> command to recover a storage pool that
has been destroyed. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool destroy tank</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool import -D</b></tt>
pool: tank
    id: 3778921145927357706
 state: ONLINE (DESTROYED)
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.  The
        pool was destroyed, but can be imported using the '-Df' flags.
config:

        tank        ONLINE
          mirror    ONLINE
            c1t0d0  ONLINE
            c1t1d0  ONLINE</pre><p>In the above <tt>zpool import</tt> output, you can identify this pool as the destroyed
pool because of the following state information:</p><pre>state: ONLINE (DESTROYED)</pre><p>To recover the destroyed pool, issue the <tt>zpool import</tt> <tt>-D</tt> command again with
the pool to be recovered and the <tt>-f</tt> option. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool import -Df tank</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool status tank</b></tt>
  pool: tank
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: none requested
config:

            c1t1d0  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors</pre><p>If one of the devices in the destroyed pool is faulted or
unavailable, you might be able to recover the destroyed pool anyway. In this
scenario, import the degraded pool and then attempt to fix the device failure.
For example:<a name="indexterm-241"></a><a name="indexterm-242"></a><a name="indexterm-243"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool destroy dozer</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool import -D</b></tt>

status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool can be imported despite missing or damaged devices.  The
        fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised if imported.  The
        pool was destroyed, but can be imported using the '-Df' flags.

<a name="gcikw"></a><h4>Upgrading ZFS Storage Pools</h4>
<p>If you have ZFS storage pools from a previous Solaris release, such as
the Solaris 10 6/06 release, you can upgrade your pools with the
<tt>zpool upgrade</tt> command to take advantage of the pool features in the Solaris 10
11/06 release. In addition, the <tt>zpool status</tt> command has been modified to notify you
when your pools are running older versions. For example:<a name="indexterm-244"></a><a name="indexterm-245"></a><a name="indexterm-246"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool status</b></tt>
  pool: test
 state: ONLINE
status: The pool is formatted using an older on-disk format.  The pool can
        still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Upgrade the pool using 'zpool upgrade'.  Once this is done, the
        pool will no longer be accessible on older software versions.
 scrub: none requested
