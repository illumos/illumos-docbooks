<a name="gayov"></a><h3>Using ZFS on a Solaris System With Zones Installed</h3>
<p>The following sections describe how to use ZFS on a system with
Solaris zones.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#gbbrq">Adding ZFS File Systems to a Non-Global Zone</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gbbst">Delegating Datasets to a Non-Global Zone</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#gbbre">Understanding the <tt>zoned</tt> Property</a></p></li></ul>
<p>Keep the following points in mind when associating ZFS datasets with zones:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can add a ZFS file system or a ZFS clone to a non-global with or without delegating administrative control.</p></li>
<li><p>You can add a ZFS volume as a device to non-global zones</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot associate ZFS snapshots with zones at this time</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use a ZFS file system for a global zone root path or a non-global zone root path in the Solaris 10 releases. You can use ZFS as a zone root path in the Solaris Express releases, but keep in mind that patching or upgrading these zones is not supported.</p></li></ul>
<p>In the sections below, a ZFS dataset refers to a file system
or clone.</p><p>Adding a dataset allows the non-global zone to share space with the global
zone, though the zone administrator cannot control properties or create new file systems
in the underlying file system hierarchy. This is identical to adding any other
type of file system to a zone, and should be used when the
primary purpose is solely to share common space.</p><p>ZFS also allows datasets to be delegated to a non-global zone, giving complete
control over the dataset and all its children to the zone administrator. The
zone administrator can create and destroy file systems or clones within that dataset,
and modify properties of the datasets. The zone administrator cannot affect datasets that
have not been added to the zone, and cannot exceed any top-level quotas
set on the exported dataset.<a name="indexterm-563"></a><a name="indexterm-564"></a></p><p>Consider the following interactions when working with ZFS on a system with Solaris
zones installed:</p>
<ul><li><p>A ZFS file system that is added to a non-global zone must have its <tt>mountpoint</tt> property set to legacy.</p></li>
<li><p>When a source <tt>zonepath</tt> and the target <tt>zonepath</tt> both reside on ZFS and are in the same pool, <tt>zoneadm clone</tt> will now automatically use ZFS clone to clone a zone. The <tt>zoneadm clone</tt> command will take a ZFS snapshot of the source <tt>zonepath</tt> and set up the target <tt>zonepath</tt>. You cannot use the <tt>zfs clone</tt> command to clone a zone. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2450/zone?a=view">Part&nbsp;II, Zones, in <i>System Administration Guide: Virtualization Using the Solaris Operating System</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gbbrq"></a><h4>Adding ZFS File Systems to a Non-Global Zone</h4>
<p>You can add a ZFS file system as a generic file system
when the goal is solely to share space with the global zone. A
ZFS file system that is added to a non-global zone must have its
<tt>mountpoint</tt> property set to legacy.</p><p>You can add a ZFS file system to a non-global zone by
using the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command's <tt>add fs</tt> subcommand. For example:<a name="indexterm-565"></a><a name="indexterm-566"></a><a name="indexterm-567"></a></p><p>In the following example, a ZFS file system is added to a
non-global zone by a global administrator in the global zone.</p><pre># <tt><b>zonecfg -z zion</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion> <tt><b>add fs</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:fs> <tt><b>set type=zfs</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:fs> <tt><b>set special=tank/zone/zion</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:fs> <tt><b>set dir=/export/shared</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:fs> <tt><b>end</b></tt></pre><p>This syntax adds the ZFS file system, <tt>tank/zone/zion</tt>, to the already configured <tt>zion</tt>
zone, mounted at <tt>/export/shared</tt>. The <tt>mountpoint</tt> property of the file system must be
set to <tt>legacy</tt>, and the file system cannot already be mounted in another
location. The zone administrator can create and destroy files within the file system.
The file system cannot be remounted in a different location, nor can the
zone administrator change properties on the file system such as atime, readonly, compression,
and so on.  The global zone administrator is responsible for setting and
controlling properties of the file system.</p><p>For more information about the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command and about configuring resource types with
<tt>zonecfg</tt>, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2450/zone?a=view">Part&nbsp;II, Zones, in <i>System Administration Guide: Virtualization Using the Solaris Operating System</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbbst"></a><h4>Delegating Datasets to a Non-Global Zone</h4>
<p>If the primary goal is to delegate the administration of storage to a
zone, then ZFS supports adding datasets to a non-global zone through use of
the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command's <tt>add dataset</tt> subcommand.<a name="indexterm-568"></a><a name="indexterm-569"></a><a name="indexterm-570"></a></p><p>In the following example, a ZFS file system is delegated to a
non-global zone by a global administrator in the global zone.</p><pre># <tt><b>zonecfg -z zion</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion> <tt><b>add dataset</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:dataset> <tt><b>set name=tank/zone/zion</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:dataset> <tt><b>end</b></tt></pre><p>Unlike adding a file system, this syntax causes the ZFS file system
<tt>tank/zone/zion</tt> to be visible within the already configured <tt>zion</tt> zone. The zone
administrator can set file system properties, as well as create children. In addition,
the zone administrator can take snapshots, create clones, and otherwise control the entire
file system hierarchy.</p><p>For more information about what actions are allowed within zones, see <a href="#gbbsn">Managing ZFS Properties Within a Zone</a>.</p>

<a name="gbebi"></a><h4>Adding ZFS Volumes to a Non-Global Zone</h4>
<p>ZFS volumes cannot be added to a non-global zone by using the
<tt>zonecfg</tt> command's <tt>add dataset</tt> subcommand. If an attempt to add an ZFS volume is
detected, the zone cannot boot. However, volumes can be added to a zone
by using the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command's <tt>add device</tt> subcommand.<a name="indexterm-571"></a><a name="indexterm-572"></a><a name="indexterm-573"></a></p><p>In the following example, a ZFS volume is added to a non-global
zone by a global administrator in the global zone:</p><pre># <tt><b>zonecfg -z zion</b></tt>
zion: No such zone configured
Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.
zonecfg:zion> <tt><b>create</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion> <tt><b>add device</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:device> <tt><b>set match=/dev/zvol/dsk/tank/vol</b></tt>
zonecfg:zion:device> <tt><b>end</b></tt></pre><p>This syntax exports the <tt>tank/vol</tt> volume to the zone. Note that adding a
raw volume to a zone has implicit security risks, even if the volume
doesn't correspond to a physical device. In particular, the zone administrator could create
malformed file systems that would panic the system when a mount is attempted.
For more information about adding devices to zones and the related security risks,
see <a href="#gbbre">Understanding the <tt>zoned</tt> Property</a>.</p><p>For more information about adding devices to zones, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2450/zone?a=view">Part&nbsp;II, Zones, in <i>System Administration Guide: Virtualization Using the Solaris Operating System</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbbso"></a><h4>Using ZFS Storage Pools Within a Zone</h4>
<p>ZFS storage pools cannot be created or modified within a zone. The
delegated administration model centralizes control of physical storage devices within the global zone and
control of virtual storage to non-global zones. While a pool-level dataset can be
added to a zone, any command that modifies the physical characteristics of the
pool, such as creating, adding, or removing devices, is not allowed from within
a zone. Even if physical devices are added to a zone by using
the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command's <tt>add device</tt> subcommand, or if files are used, the <tt>zpool</tt> command
does not allow the creation of any new pools within the zone.</p>

<a name="gbbsn"></a><h4>Managing ZFS Properties Within a Zone</h4>
<p>After a dataset is added to a zone, the zone administrator can
control specific dataset properties. When a dataset is added to a zone, all
its ancestors are visible as read-only datasets, while the dataset itself is writable
as are all of its children. For example, consider the following configuration:<a name="indexterm-574"></a><a name="indexterm-575"></a><a name="indexterm-576"></a></p><pre>global# <tt><b>zfs list -Ho name</b></tt>
tank
tank/home
tank/data
tank/data/matrix
tank/data/zion
tank/data/zion/home</pre><p>If <tt>tank/data/zion</tt> is added to a zone, each dataset would have the following
properties.</p><table><col width="25*"><col width="25*"><col width="25*"><col width="25*"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" scope="column"><p>Dataset</p></th>

</tr>
</table><p>Note that every parent of <tt>tank/zone/zion</tt> is visible read-only, all children are writable,
and datasets that are not part of the parent hierarchy are not visible
at all. The zone administrator cannot change the <tt>sharenfs</tt> property, because non-global zones
cannot act as NFS servers. Neither can the zone administrator change the <tt>zoned</tt>
property, because doing so would expose a security risk as described in the
next section. </p><p>Any other settable property can be changed, except for the <tt>quota</tt> property, and
the dataset itself. This behavior allows the global zone administrator to control the
space consumption of all datasets used by the non-global zone.</p><p>In addition, the <tt>sharenfs</tt> and <tt>mountpoint</tt> properties cannot be changed by the global
zone administrator once a dataset has been added to a non-global zone.</p>

<a name="gbbre"></a><h4>Understanding the <tt>zoned</tt> Property</h4>
<p>When a dataset is added to a non-global zone, the dataset must
be specially marked so that certain properties are not interpreted within the context
of the global zone. After a dataset has been added to a non-global
zone under the control of a zone administrator, its contents can no longer
be trusted. As with any file system, there might be setuid binaries, symbolic
links, or otherwise questionable contents that might adversely affect the security of the global
zone. In addition, the <tt>mountpoint</tt> property cannot be interpreted in the context of
the global zone. Otherwise, the zone administrator could affect the global zone's namespace.
To address the latter, ZFS uses the <tt>zoned</tt> property to indicate that a
dataset has been delegated to a non-global zone at one point in time.<a name="indexterm-577"></a><a name="indexterm-578"></a><a name="indexterm-579"></a></p><p>The <tt>zoned</tt> property is a boolean value that is automatically turned on when
a zone containing a ZFS dataset is first booted. A zone administrator will
not need to manually turn on this property. If the <tt>zoned</tt> property is
set, the dataset cannot be mounted or shared in the global zone,
and is ignored when the <tt>zfs share</tt> <tt>-a</tt> command or the <tt>zfs mount</tt> <tt>-a</tt> command is
executed. In the following example, <tt>tank/zone/zion</tt> has been added to a zone, while <tt>tank/zone/global</tt>
has not:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs list -o name,zoned,mountpoint -r tank/zone</b></tt>
NAME                  ZONED  MOUNTPOINT
tank/zone/global        off  /tank/zone/global
tank/zone/zion           on  /tank/zone/zion
# <tt><b>zfs mount</b></tt>
tank/zone/global           /tank/zone/global
tank/zone/zion             /export/zone/zion/root/tank/zone/zion</pre><p>Note the difference between the <tt>mountpoint</tt> property and the directory where the <tt>tank/zone/zion</tt>
dataset is currently mounted. The <tt>mountpoint</tt> property reflects the property as stored on disk,
not where the dataset is currently mounted on the system.</p><p>When a dataset is removed from a zone or a zone is
destroyed, the <tt>zoned</tt> property is <b>not</b> automatically cleared. This behavior is due to
the inherent security risks associated with these tasks. Because an untrusted user has
had complete access to the dataset and its children, the <tt>mountpoint</tt> property might
be set to bad values, or setuid binaries might exist on the file
systems.</p><p>To prevent accidental security risks, the <tt>zoned</tt> property must be manually cleared by
the global administrator if you want to reuse the dataset in any way.
Before setting the <tt>zoned</tt> property to <tt>off</tt>, make sure that the <tt>mountpoint</tt> property for
the dataset and all its children are set to reasonable values and
that no setuid binaries exist, or turn off the <tt>setuid</tt> property.</p><p>After you have verified that no security vulnerabilities are left, the <tt>zoned</tt> property
can be turned off by using the <tt>zfs set</tt> or <tt>zfs inherit</tt> commands. If the <tt>zoned</tt>
property is turned off while a dataset is in use within a zone,
the system might behave in unpredictable ways. Only change the property if you
are sure the dataset is no longer in use by a non-global zone.</p>
