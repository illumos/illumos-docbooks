<a name="gayrd"></a><h3>Managing Devices in ZFS Storage Pools</h3>
<p>Most of the basic information regarding devices is covered in <a href="gcfog.html">Components of a ZFS Storage Pool</a>. Once
a pool has been created, you can perform several tasks to manage the
physical devices within the pool.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#gazgw">Adding Devices to a Storage Pool</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gcfhe">Attaching and Detaching Devices in a Storage Pool</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gazgm">Onlining and Offlining Devices in a Storage Pool</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gazge">Clearing Storage Pool Devices</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#gcvcw">Designating Hot Spares in Your Storage Pool</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="gazgw"></a><h4>Adding Devices to a Storage Pool</h4>
<p>You can dynamically add space to a pool by adding a new
top-level virtual device. This space is immediately available to all datasets within the
pool. To add a new virtual device to a pool, use the <tt>zpool add</tt>
command. For example:<a name="indexterm-145"></a><a name="indexterm-146"></a><a name="indexterm-147"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool add zeepool mirror c2t1d0 c2t2d0</b></tt></pre><p>The format of the virtual devices is the same as for the
<tt>zpool create</tt> command, and the same rules apply. Devices are checked to determine if
they are in use, and the command cannot change the level of
redundancy without the <tt>-f</tt> option. The command also supports the <tt>-n</tt> option so that
you can perform a dry run. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool add -n zeepool mirror c3t1d0 c3t2d0</b></tt>
would update 'zeepool' to the following configuration:
      zeepool
        mirror
            c1t0d0
            c1t1d0
        mirror
            c2t1d0
            c2t2d0
        mirror
            c3t1d0
            c3t2d0</pre><p>This command syntax would add mirrored devices <tt>c3t1d0</tt> and <tt>c3t2d0</tt> to <tt>zeepool</tt>'s
existing configuration.</p><p>For more information about how virtual device validation is done, see <a href="gaypw.html#gazht">Detecting in Use Devices</a>.</p><a name="gevok"></a>Example&nbsp;4-1 Adding Disks to a RAID-Z Configuration<p>Additional disks can be added similarly to a RAID-Z configuration.

<a name="gazgm"></a><h4>Onlining and Offlining Devices in a Storage Pool</h4>
<p>ZFS allows individual devices to be taken offline or brought online. When hardware
is unreliable or not functioning properly, ZFS continues to read or write data
to the device, assuming the condition is only temporary. If the condition is
not temporary, it is possible to instruct ZFS to ignore the device by
bringing it offline. ZFS does not send any requests to an offlined device.<a name="indexterm-162"></a><a name="indexterm-163"></a></p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Devices do not need to be taken offline in order to replace
them.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can use the <tt>offline</tt> command when you need to temporarily disconnect storage.
For example, if you need to physically disconnect an array from one set
of Fibre Channel switches and connect the array to a different set, you
could take the LUNs offline from the array that was used in ZFS
storage pools. After the array was reconnected and operational on the new set
of switches, you could then bring the same LUNs online. Data that had
been added to the storage pools while the LUNs were offline would
resilver to the LUNs after they were brought back online.</p><p>This scenario is possible assuming that the systems in question see the storage
once it is attached to the new switches, possibly through different controllers than
before, and your pools are set up as RAID-Z or mirrored configurations.</p>

<a name="gazfy"></a><h5>Taking a Device Offline</h5>
<p>You can take a device offline by using the <tt>zpool offline</tt> command. The device
can be specified by path or by short name, if the device
is a disk. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool offline tank c1t0d0</b></tt>
bringing device c1t0d0 offline</pre><p>Keep the following points in mind when taking a device offline:</p>
<ul><li><p>You cannot take a pool offline to the point where it becomes faulted. For example, you cannot take offline two devices out of a RAID-Z configuration, nor can you take offline a top-level virtual device.<a name="indexterm-164"></a><a name="indexterm-165"></a><a name="indexterm-166"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool offline tank c1t0d0</b></tt>
cannot offline c1t0d0: no valid replicas</pre></li>
<li><p>By default, the offline state is persistent. The device remains offline when the system is rebooted. </p><p>To temporarily take a device offline, use the <tt>zpool offline</tt> <tt>-t</tt> option. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool offline -t tank c1t0d0</b></tt>
 bringing device 'c1t0d0' offline</pre><p>When the system is rebooted, this device is automatically returned to the <tt>ONLINE</tt> state.</p></li>
<li><p>When a device is taken offline, it is not detached from the storage pool. If you attempt to use the offlined device in another pool, even after the original pool is destroyed, you will see a message similar to the following:</p><pre><i>device</i> is part of exported or potentially active ZFS <i>pool</i>. Please see zpool(1M)</pre><p>If you want to use the offlined device in another storage pool after destroying the original storage pool, first bring the device back online, then destroy the original storage pool.</p><p>Another way to use a device from another storage pool if you want to keep the original storage pool is to replace the existing device in the original storage pool with another comparable device. For information about replacing devices, see <a href="#gazgd">Replacing Devices in a Storage Pool</a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>Offlined devices show up in the <tt>OFFLINE</tt> state when you query pool status.
For information about querying pool status, see <a href="gaynp.html">Querying ZFS Storage Pool Status</a>.</p><p>For more information on device health, see <a href="gaynp.html#gamno">Determining the Health Status of ZFS Storage Pools</a>.</p>

<a name="gazgk"></a><h5>Bringing a Device Online</h5>
<p>Once a device is taken offline, it can be restored by using
the <tt>zpool online</tt> command:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool online tank c1t0d0</b></tt>
bringing device c1t0d0 online</pre><p>When a device is brought online, any data that has been written
to the pool is resynchronized to the newly available device. Note that you
cannot use device onlining to replace a disk. If you offline a device,
replace the drive, and try to bring it online, it remains in the
faulted state.<a name="indexterm-167"></a><a name="indexterm-168"></a><a name="indexterm-169"></a></p><p>If you attempt to online a faulted device, a message similar to
the following is displayed from <tt>fmd</tt>:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool online tank c1t0d0</b></tt>
Bringing device c1t0d0 online

REC-ACTION: Run 'zpool status -x' and replace the bad device.</pre><p>For more information on replacing a faulted device, see <a href="gbbvb.html">Repairing a Missing Device</a>.</p>

<a name="gazge"></a><h4>Clearing Storage Pool Devices</h4>
<p>If a device is taken offline due to a failure that causes
errors to be listed in the <tt>zpool status</tt> output, you can clear the error counts
with the <tt>zpool clear</tt> command. <a name="indexterm-170"></a><a name="indexterm-171"></a></p><p>If specified with no arguments, this command clears all device errors within the
pool. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool clear tank</b></tt></pre><p>If one or more devices are specified, this command only clear errors associated
with the specified devices. For example:<a name="indexterm-172"></a><a name="indexterm-173"></a><a name="indexterm-174"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool clear tank c1t0d0</b></tt></pre><p>For more information on clearing <tt>zpool</tt> errors, see <a href="gbbvf.html#gbbzv">Clearing Transient Errors</a>.</p>

<a name="gazgd"></a><h4>Replacing Devices in a Storage Pool</h4>
<p>You can replace a device in a storage pool by using the
<tt>zpool replace</tt> command.<a name="indexterm-175"></a><a name="indexterm-176"></a><a name="indexterm-177"></a></p><p>If you are physically replacing a device with another device in the same
location in a redundant pool, then you only need identify the replaced device.
ZFS recognizes that it is a different disk in the same location.
For example, to replace a failed disk (<tt>c1t1d0</tt>) by removing the disk and replacing
it in the same location, use the syntax similar to the following:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool replace tank c1t1d0</b></tt></pre><p>If you are replacing a device in a non-redundant storage pool that
contains only one device, you will need to specify both devices. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool replace tank c1t1d0 c1t2d0</b></tt></pre><p>Keep the following considerations in mind when replacing devices in a ZFS storage
pool:</p>
<ul><li><p>The replacement device must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of all the devices in a mirrored or RAID-Z configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>If the replacement device is larger, the pool capacity is increased when the replacement is complete. Currently, you must export and import the pool to see the expanded capacity. For example:</p><pre># zpool list tank
NAME   SIZE   USED  AVAIL    CAP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
tank  16.8G    94K  16.7G     0%  ONLINE  -
# zpool replace tank c0t0d0 c0t4d0
# zpool list tank
NAME   SIZE   USED  AVAIL    CAP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
tank  16.8G   112K  16.7G     0%  ONLINE  -
# zpool export tank
# zpool import tank
# zpool list tank
NAME   SIZE   USED  AVAIL    CAP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
tank  33.9G   114K  33.9G     0%  ONLINE  -</pre><p>For more information about exporting and importing pools, see <a href="gbchy.html">Migrating ZFS Storage Pools</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, you must also perform the export and import steps when growing the size of an existing LUN that is part of a storage pool to see the expanded capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacing many disks in a large pool is time consuming due to resilvering the data onto the new disks. In addition, you might consider running the <tt>zpool scrub</tt> command between disk replacements to ensure that the replacement devices are operational and the data is written correctly.</p></li></ul>

<a name="gcvcw"></a><h4>Designating Hot Spares in Your Storage Pool</h4>
<p>The hot spares feature enables you to identify disks that could be
used to replace a failed or faulted device in one or more storage
pools. Designating a device as a <b>hot spare</b> means that the device is not an
active device in a pool, but if an active device in the
pool fails, the hot spare automatically replaces the failed device.<a name="indexterm-178"></a></p><p>Devices can be designated as hot spares in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>When the pool is created with the <tt>zpool create</tt> command</p></li>
<li><p>After the pool is created with the <tt>zpool add</tt> command</p></li>
<li><p>Hot spare devices can be shared between multiple pools</p></li></ul>
<p>Designate devices as hot spares when the pool is created. For example:<a name="indexterm-179"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zpool create zeepool mirror c1t1d0 c2t1d0 spare c1t2d0 c2t2d0</b></tt>

the storage pool.</p><p>Keep the following points in mind when using ZFS hot spares:</p>
<ul><li><p>Currently, the <tt>zpool remove</tt> command can only be used to remove hot spares.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a disk as a spare that is equal to or larger than the size of the largest disk in the pool. Adding a smaller disk as a spare to a pool is allowed. However, when the smaller spare disk is activated, either automatically or with the <tt>zpool replace</tt> command, the operation fails with an error similar to the following:</p><pre>cannot replace <i>disk3</i> with <i>disk4</i>: device is too small</pre></li></ul>


<a name="gcvdi"></a><h5>Activating and Deactivating Hot Spares in Your Storage Pool</h5>
<p>Hot spares are activated in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>Manually replacement &ndash; Replace a failed device in a storage pool with a hot spare by using the <tt>zpool replace</tt> command.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic replacement &ndash; When a fault is received, an FMA agent examines the pool to see if it has any available hot spares. If so, it replaces the faulted device with an available spare.</p><p>If a hot spare that is currently in use fails, the agent detaches the spare and thereby cancels the replacement. The agent then attempts to replace the device with another hot spare, if one is available. This feature is currently limited by the fact that the ZFS diagnosis engine only emits faults when a device disappears from the system. </p><p>Currently, no automated response is available to bring the original device back online. You must explicitly take one of the actions described in the example below. A future enhancement will allow ZFS to subscribe to hotplug events and automatically replace the affected device when it is replaced on the system.</p></li></ul>
<p>Manually replace a device with a hot spare by using the <tt>zpool replace</tt>
command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zpool replace zeepool c2t1d0 c2t3d0</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zpool status zeepool</b></tt>
