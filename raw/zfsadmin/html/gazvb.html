<a name="gazvb"></a><h3>ZFS Quotas and Reservations</h3>
<p>ZFS supports quotas and reservations at the file system level. You can use
the <tt>quota</tt> property to set a limit on the amount of space a
file system can use. In addition, you can use the <tt>reservation</tt> property to
guarantee that some amount of space is available to a file system.
Both properties apply to the dataset they are set on and all descendents
of that dataset.<a name="indexterm-450"></a></p><p>That is, if a quota is set on the <tt>tank/home</tt> dataset, the total
amount of space used by <tt>tank/home</tt> <b>and all of its descendents</b> cannot exceed the quota. Similarly,
if <tt>tank/home</tt> is given a reservation, <tt>tank/home</tt> <b>and all of its descendents</b> draw from that reservation.
The amount of space used by a dataset and all of its descendents
is reported by the <tt>used</tt> property.</p><p>In addition to the <tt>quota</tt> and <tt>reservation</tt> property, the <tt>refquota</tt> and <tt>refreservation</tt>
properties are available to manage file system space without accounting for space consumed
by descendents, such as snapshots and clones.</p><p>Consider the following points to determine which quota and reservations features might better
manage your file systems:</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>quota</tt> and <tt>reservation</tt> properties are convenient for managing space consumed by datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>refquota</tt> and <tt>refreservation</tt> properties are appropriate for managing space consumed by datasets and snapshots. </p></li>
<li><p>Setting <tt>refquota</tt> or <tt>refreservation</tt> higher than quota or reservation have no effect. If you set the <tt>quota</tt> or <tt>refquota</tt> properties, operations that try to exceed either value fail. It is possible to a exceed a <tt>quota</tt> that is greater than <tt>refquota</tt>. If some snapshot blocks are dirtied, you might actually exceed the <tt>quota</tt> before you exceed the <tt>refquota</tt>.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see the examples below.</p>

<a name="gazud"></a><h4>Setting Quotas on ZFS File Systems</h4>
<p>ZFS quotas can be set and displayed by using the <tt>zfs set</tt> and
<tt>zfs get</tt> commands. In the following example, a quota of 10 Gbytes is set
on <tt>tank/home/bonwick</tt>.<a name="indexterm-451"></a><a name="indexterm-452"></a><a name="indexterm-453"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set quota=10G tank/home/bonwick</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs get quota tank/home/bonwick</b></tt>
NAME              PROPERTY      VALUE                      SOURCE
tank/home/bonwick quota         10.0G                      local</pre><p>ZFS quotas also impact the output of the <tt>zfs list</tt> and <tt>df</tt> commands.
For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                   USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
tank/home             16.5K  33.5G  8.50K  /export/home
tank/home/bonwick     15.0K  10.0G  8.50K  /export/home/bonwick
tank/home/bonwick/ws  6.50K  10.0G  8.50K  /export/home/bonwick/ws
# <tt><b>df -h /export/home/bonwick</b></tt>
Filesystem             size   used  avail capacity  Mounted on
tank/home/bonwick       10G     8K    10G     1%    /export/home/bonwick</pre><p>Note that although <tt>tank/home</tt> has 33.5 Gbytes of space available, <tt>tank/home/bonwick</tt> and <tt>tank/home/bonwick/ws</tt>
only have 10 Gbytes of space available, due to the quota on
<tt>tank/home/bonwick</tt>.</p><p>You cannot set a quota to an amount less than is currently
being used by a dataset. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set quota=10K tank/home/bonwick</b></tt>
cannot set quota for 'tank/home/bonwick': size is less than current used or 
reserved space</pre><p>You can set a <tt>refquota</tt> on a dataset that limits the amount
of space that the dataset can consume. This hard limit does not include
space that is consumed by snapshots and clones. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set refquota=10g students/studentA</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
profs               106K  33.2G    18K  /profs
students           57.7M  33.2G    19K  /students
students/studentA  57.5M  9.94G  57.5M  /students/studentA
# <tt><b>zfs snapshot students/studentA@today</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
profs                     106K  33.2G    18K  /profs
students                 57.7M  33.2G    19K  /students
students/studentA        57.5M  9.94G  57.5M  /students/studentA
students/studentA@today      0      -  57.5M  -</pre><p>For additional convenience, you can set another quota on a dataset to help
manage the space that is consumed by snapshots. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set quota=20g students/studentA</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
profs                     106K  33.2G    18K  /profs
students                 57.7M  33.2G    19K  /students
students/studentA        57.5M  9.94G  57.5M  /students/studentA
students/studentA@today      0      -  57.5M  -</pre><p>In this scenario, <tt>studentA</tt> can bump into the refquota (10 Gbytes) hard
limit and remove files to recover even if snapshots exist.</p><p>In the above example, the smaller of the two quotas (10 Gbytes versus
20 Gbytes) is displayed in the <tt>zfs list</tt> output. To see the value
of both quotas, use the <tt>zfs get</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs get refquota,quota students/studentA</b></tt>
NAME               PROPERTY  VALUE              SOURCE
students/studentA  refquota  10G                local
students/studentA  quota     20G                local</pre>

<a name="gbdbb"></a><h4>Setting Reservations on ZFS File Systems</h4>
<p>A ZFS <b>reservation</b> is an allocation of space from the pool that is
guaranteed to be available to a dataset. As such, you cannot reserve space
for a dataset if that space is not currently available in the pool.
The total amount of all outstanding unconsumed reservations cannot exceed the amount of
unused space in the pool. ZFS reservations can be set and displayed by
using the <tt>zfs set</tt> and <tt>zfs get</tt> commands. For example:<a name="indexterm-454"></a><a name="indexterm-455"></a><a name="indexterm-456"></a></p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set reservation=5G tank/home/moore</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs get reservation tank/home/moore</b></tt>
NAME             PROPERTY      VALUE                      SOURCE
tank/home/moore  reservation   5.00G                      local</pre><p>ZFS reservations can affect the output of the <tt>zfs list</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                   USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
tank/home             5.00G  33.5G  8.50K  /export/home
tank/home/moore       15.0K  10.0G  8.50K  /export/home/moore</pre><p>Note that <tt>tank/home</tt> is using 5 Gbytes of space, although the total amount
of space referred to by <tt>tank/home</tt> and its descendents is much less than
5 Gbytes. The used space reflects the space reserved for <tt>tank/home/moore</tt>. Reservations are
considered in the used space of the parent dataset and do count against
its quota, reservation, or both.</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set quota=5G pool/filesystem</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs set reservation=10G pool/filesystem/user1</b></tt>
cannot set reservation for 'pool/filesystem/user1': size is greater than 
available space</pre><p>A dataset can use more space than its reservation, as long as
space is available in the pool that is unreserved and the dataset's current
usage is below its quota. A dataset cannot consume space that has been
reserved for another dataset.</p><p>Reservations are not cumulative. That is, a second invocation of <tt>zfs set</tt> to
set a reservation does not add its reservation to the existing reservation. Rather,
the second reservation replaces the first reservation.</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set reservation=10G tank/home/moore</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs set reservation=5G tank/home/moore</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs get reservation tank/home/moore</b></tt>
NAME             PROPERTY      VALUE                      SOURCE
tank/home/moore  reservation   5.00G                      local</pre><p>You can set a <tt>refreservation</tt> to guarantee space for a dataset that does not
include space consumed by snapshots and clones. The <tt>refreservation</tt> reservation is accounted
for in the parent datasets' space used, and counts against the parent datasets'
quotas and reservations. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set refreservation=10g profs/prof1</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
profs                    10.0G  23.2G    19K  /profs
profs/prof1                10G  33.2G    18K  /profs/prof1</pre><p>You can also set a reservation on the same dataset to guarantee dataset
space and snapshot space. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set reservation=20g profs/prof1</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs list</b></tt>
NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
profs                    20.0G  13.2G    19K  /profs
profs/prof1                10G  33.2G    18K  /profs/prof1</pre><p>Regular reservations are accounted for in the parent's used space.</p><p>In the above example, the smaller of the two quotas (10 Gbytes versus
20 Gbytes) is displayed in the <tt>zfs list</tt> output. To see the value of both
quotas, use the <tt>zfs get</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs get reservation,refreserv profs/prof1</b></tt>
NAME         PROPERTY        VALUE        SOURCE
profs/prof1  reservation     20G          local
profs/prof1  refreservation  10G          local</pre><p>If <tt>refreservation</tt> is set, a snapshot is only allowed if enough free
pool space exists outside of this reservation to accommodate the current number of
<b>referenced</b> bytes in the dataset.</p>
