<para><phrase role="first-word">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS.</phrase></para>

<blockquote>
    <para>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Commercial Use&rdquo; means distribution or otherwise making the Documentation available to a third party.</para>

    <para>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Contributor&rdquo; means a person or entity who creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.</para>

    <para>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; means the Original Documentation or Modifications or the combination of the Original Documentation and Modifications, in each case including portions thereof.</para>

    <para>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Editable Form&rdquo; means the preferred form of Documentation for
         making Modifications to such documentation. The Documentation
         can be in an electronic, compressed or archival form, provided
         the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is
         widely available for no charge.</para>

     <para>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&rdquo; means a mechanism generally
         accepted for the electronic transfer of data.</para>

     <para>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Initial Writer&rdquo; means the individual or entity identified as
         the Initial Writer in the notice required by the Appendix.</para>

     <para>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Larger Work&rdquo; means a work which combines Documentation or
         portions thereof with documentation or other writings not
         governed by the terms of this License.</para>

     <para>1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;License&rdquo; means this document.</para>

     <para>1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Modifications&rdquo; means any addition to or deletion from the
         substance or structure of either the Original Documentation
         or any previous Modifications, such as a translation,
         abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
         Original Documentation or previous Modifications may be
         recast, transformed or adapted. A work consisting of
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, and other
         modifications which, as a whole represent an original work of
         authorship, is a Modification. For example, when
         Documentation is released as a series of documents, a
         Modification is:</para>

     <blockquote>
         <para>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any addition to or deletion from the contents of the
             Original Documentation or previous Modifications.</para>

         <para>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new documentation that contains any part of the
             Original Documentation or previous Modifications.</para>
     </blockquote>

     <para>1.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Original Documentation&rdquo; means documentation described as
          Original Documentation in the notice required by the
          Appendix, and which, at the time of its release under this
          License is not already Documentation governed by this
          License.</para>

      <para>1.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Your&rdquo;) means an individual or a legal
          entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
          the terms of, this License or a future version of this
          License issued under Section 5.0 (&ldquo;Versions of the
          License&rdquo;). For legal entities, &ldquo;You&rdquo; includes any entity
          which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
          with You. For purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; means
          (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
          management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,
          or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
          outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.</para>

    where a reader would be likely to look for such a notice, for
    example, via a hyperlink in each file of the Documentation that
    takes the reader to a page that describes the origin and ownership
    of the Documentation. If You created one or more Modification(s)
    You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in

    describe recipients' rights or ownership rights.</para>

    <para>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Documentation. However, You may do so only on Your
    own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Writer or any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Writer
    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
