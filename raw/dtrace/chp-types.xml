used to declare an identifier as an alias for an existing type. Like all D
type declarations, the <literal>typedef</literal> keyword is used outside
probe clauses in a declaration of the form:</para><programlisting>typedef <replaceable>existing-type</replaceable> <replaceable>new-type</replaceable> ;</programlisting><para>where <replaceable>existing-type</replaceable> is any type declaration
and <replaceable>new-type</replaceable> is an identifier to be used as the
alias for this type. For example, the declaration:</para><programlisting>typedef unsigned char uint8_t;</programlisting><para>is used internally by the D compiler to create the <literal>uint8_t</literal> type
alias. Type aliases can be used anywhere that a normal type can be used, such
as the type of a variable or associative array value or tuple member. You
can also combine <literal>typedef</literal> with more elaborate declarations
such as the definition of a new <literal>struct</literal>:</para><programlisting>typedef struct foo {
	int x;
	int y;
} foo_t;</programlisting><para>In this example, <literal>struct foo</literal> is defined as the same
type as its alias, <literal>foo_t</literal>. Solaris C system headers often
use the suffix <literal>_t</literal> to denote a <literal>typedef</literal> alias.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="chp-types-2"><title>Enumerations</title><para><indexterm><primary>enumeration</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>enumeration of symbolic names</primary></indexterm>Defining symbolic names for constants
in a program eases readability and simplifies the process of maintaining the
program in the future. One method is to define an <firstterm>enumeration</firstterm>,
which associates a set of integers with a set of identifiers called enumerators
that the compiler recognizes and replaces with the corresponding integer value.
An enumeration is defined using a declaration such as:</para><programlisting>enum colors {
	RED,
	GREEN,
	BLUE
};</programlisting><para>The first enumerator in the enumeration, <literal>RED</literal>, is
assigned the value zero and each subsequent identifier is assigned the next
integer value. You can also specify an explicit integer value for any enumerator
by suffixing it with an equal sign and an integer constant, as in the following
example:</para><programlisting>enum colors {
	RED = 7,
	GREEN = 9,
	BLUE
};</programlisting><para>The enumerator <literal>BLUE</literal> is assigned the value 10 by the
compiler because it has no value specified and the previous enumerator is
set to 9. Once an enumeration is defined, the enumerators can be used anywhere
in a D program that an integer constant can be used. In addition, the enumeration <literal>enum colors</literal> is also defined as a type that is equivalent to an <literal>int</literal>. The D compiler will allow a variable of <literal>enum</literal> type
to be used anywhere an <literal>int</literal> can be used, and will allow
any integer value to be assigned to a variable of <literal>enum</literal> type.
You can also omit the <literal>enum</literal> name in the declaration if the
type name is not needed.</para><para>Enumerators are visible in all subsequent clauses and declarations in
your program, so you cannot define the same enumerator identifier in more
than one enumeration. However, you may define more than one enumerator that
has the same value in either the same or different enumerations. You may also
assign integers that have no corresponding enumerator to a variable of the
enumeration type.</para><para><indexterm><primary>enumeration</primary><secondary>syntax</secondary></indexterm>The D enumeration syntax is the same as the corresponding syntax
in ANSI-C. D also provides access to enumerations defined in the operating
system kernel and its loadable modules, but these enumerators are not globally
visible in your D program. Kernel enumerators are only visible when used as
an argument to one of the binary comparison operators when compared to an
object of the corresponding enumeration type. For example, the function <olink targetdoc="refman9f" targetptr="uiomove-9f" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>uiomove</refentrytitle><manvolnum>9F</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> has a parameter of type <literal>enum uio_rw</literal> defined as follows:</para><programlisting>enum uio_rw { UIO_READ, UIO_WRITE };</programlisting><para><indexterm><primary>enumeration</primary><secondary>UIO_WRITE visibility</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>enumeration</primary><secondary>UIO_READ visibility</secondary></indexterm> <indexterm><primary>examples</primary><secondary>enumeration</secondary></indexterm>The enumerators <literal>UIO_READ</literal> and <literal>UIO_WRITE</literal> are not normally visible in your D program, but you can
promote them to global visibility by comparing a value of type <literal>enum uio_rw</literal>, as shown in the following example clause:</para><programlisting>fbt::uiomove:entry
/args[2] == UIO_WRITE/
{
	...
}</programlisting><para>This example traces calls to the <olink targetdoc="refman9f" targetptr="uiomove-9f" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>uiomove</refentrytitle><manvolnum>9F</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> function for write requests
by comparing <literal>args[2]</literal>, a variable of type <literal>enum
uio_rw</literal>, to the enumerator <literal>UIO_WRITE</literal>. Because
the left-hand argument is an enumeration type, the D compiler searches the
enumeration when attempting to resolve the right-hand identifier. This feature
protects your D programs against inadvertent identifier name conflicts with
the large collection of enumerations defined in the operating system kernel.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="chp-types-3"><title>Inlines</title><para><indexterm><primary>inline directives</primary></indexterm>D named constants
can also be defined using <literal>inline</literal> directives, which provide
a more general means of creating identifiers that are replaced by predefined
values or expressions during compilation. Inline directives are a more powerful
form of lexical replacement than the <literal>#define</literal> directive
provided by the C preprocessor because the replacement is assigned an actual
type and is performed using the compiled syntax tree and not simply a set
of lexical tokens. An inline directive is specified using a declaration of
the form:</para><programlisting>inline <replaceable>type</replaceable> <replaceable>name</replaceable> = <replaceable>expression</replaceable> ;</programlisting><para>where <replaceable>type</replaceable> is a type declaration of an existing
type, <replaceable>name</replaceable> is any valid D identifier that is not
previously defined as an inline or global variable, and <replaceable>expression</replaceable> is
any valid D expression. Once the inline directive is processed, the D compiler
substitutes the compiled form of <replaceable>expression</replaceable> for
each subsequent instance of <replaceable>name</replaceable> in the program
source. For example, the following D program would trace the string <literal>"hello"</literal> and integer value <literal>123</literal>:</para><programlisting>inline string hello = "hello";
inline int number = 100 + 23;

BEGIN
{
	trace(hello);
	trace(number);
}</programlisting><para>An inline name may be used anywhere a global variable of the corresponding
type can be used. If the inline expression can be evaluated to an integer
or string constant at compile time, then the inline name can also be used
in contexts that require constant expressions, such as scalar array dimensions.</para><para>The inline expression is validated for syntax errors as part of evaluating
the directive. The expression result type must be compatible with the type
defined by the inline, according to the same rules used for the D assignment
operator (<literal>=</literal>). An inline expression may not reference the
inline identifier itself: recursive definitions are not permitted.</para><para>The DTrace software packages install a number of D source files in the
system directory <filename>/usr/lib/dtrace</filename> that contain inline
directives you can use in your D programs. For example, the <filename>signal.d</filename> library
includes directives of the form:</para><programlisting>inline int SIGHUP = 1;
inline int SIGINT = 2;
inline int SIGQUIT = 3;
...</programlisting><para>These inline definitions provide you access to the current set of Solaris
signal names described in <olink targetdoc="refman3f" targetptr="signal-3head" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>signal</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3HEAD</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink>.
Similarly, the <filename>errno.d</filename> library contains inline directives
for the C <literal>errno</literal> constants described in <olink targetdoc="refman2" targetptr="intro-2" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>Intro</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink>.</para><para>By default, the D compiler includes all of the provided D library files
automatically so you can use these definitions in any D program.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="chp-types-4"><title>Type Namespaces</title><para><indexterm><primary>type namespaces</primary></indexterm>This section
discusses D namespaces and namespace issues related to types. In traditional
languages such as ANSI-C, type visibility is determined by whether a type
is nested inside of a function or other declaration. Types declared at the
outer scope of a C program are associated with a single global namespace and
are visible throughout the entire program. Types defined in C header files
are typically included in this outer scope. Unlike these languages, D provides
access to types from multiple outer scopes.</para><para>D is a language that facilitates dynamic observability across multiple
layers of a software stack, including the operating system kernel, an associated
set of loadable kernel modules, and user processes running on the system.
A single D program may instantiate probes to gather data from multiple kernel
modules or other software entities that are compiled into independent binary
objects. Therefore, more than one data type of the same name, perhaps with
different definitions, might be present in the universe of types available
to DTrace and the D compiler. To manage this situation, the D compiler associates
each type with a namespace identified by the containing program object. Types
from a particular program object can be accessed by specifying the object
name and backquote (<literal>`</literal>) scoping operator in any type name.</para><para>For example, if a kernel module named <literal>foo</literal> contains
the following C type declaration:</para><programlisting>typedef struct bar {
	int x;
} bar_t;</programlisting><para>then the types <literal>struct bar</literal> and <literal>bar_t</literal> could
be accessed from D using the type names:</para><programlisting>struct foo`bar				foo`bar_t</programlisting><para>The backquote operator can be used in any context where a type name
is appropriate, including when specifying the type for D variable declarations
or cast expressions in D probe clauses.</para><para><indexterm><primary>type namespaces</primary><secondary>built in</secondary></indexterm>The D compiler also provides two special built-in type namespaces
that use the names <literal>C</literal> and <literal>D</literal> respectively.
The C type namespace is initially populated with the standard ANSI-C intrinsic
types such as <literal>int</literal>. In addition, type definitions acquired
using the C preprocessor <olink targetdoc="refman1" targetptr="cpp-1" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>cpp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> using
the <command>dtrace</command> <option>C</option> option will be processed
by and added to the C scope. As a result, you can include C header files containing
type declarations which are already visible in another type namespace without
causing a compilation error.</para><para>The D type namespace is initially populated with the D type intrinsics
such as <literal>int</literal> and <literal>string</literal> as well as the
built-in D type aliases such as <literal>uint32_t</literal>. Any new type
declarations that appear in the D program source are automatically added to
the D type namespace. If you create a complex type such as a <literal>struct</literal> in
your D program consisting of member types from other namespaces, the member
types will be copied into the D namespace by the declaration.</para><para>When the D compiler encounters a type declaration that does not specify
an explicit namespace using the backquote operator, the compiler searches
the set of active type namespaces to find a match using the specified type
name. The C namespace is always searched first, followed by the D namespace.
If the type name is not found in either the C or D namespace, the type namespaces
of the active kernel modules are searched in ascending order by kernel module
ID. This ordering guarantees that the binary objects that form the core kernel
are searched before any loadable kernel modules, but does not guarantee any
ordering properties among the loadable modules. You should use the scoping
operator when accessing types defined in loadable kernel modules to avoid
type name conflicts with other kernel modules.</para><para>The D compiler uses compressed ANSI-C debugging information provided
with the core Solaris kernel modules in order to automatically access the
types associated with the operating system source code without the need for
accessing the corresponding C include files. This symbolic debugging information
might not be available for all kernel modules on your system. The D compiler
will report an error if you attempt to access a type within the namespace
of a module that lacks compressed C debugging information intended for use
with DTrace.</para>
